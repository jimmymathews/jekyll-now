title: Scholarly Village Submission to Conexus RfP
author: Joshua Meyers, James Mathews, Christian Williams
---

The pdf was a submission to Conexus AI's RfP.  Conexus AI is a
start-up which funds applications of category theory.  The proposal
does not seek profit, so it was submitted with an understanding that
it would not be funded, and instead we would just be connected to
potential collaborators.
