This is intended to be a serious record of economic and technical practices that individuals can use to promote free scholarship and critical inquiry in their present or future communities.

It is hoped that first-time contributors will propose their own detailed, pragmatic models for an actual community designed to promote these activities, addressing, if appropriate:

  - location, facilities
  - duration; seasonality
  - routine
  - scale, scope
  - relation to technologies
  - funding
  - membership
  - legal structure
  - comparison with existing institutions

Non-novel debate concerning the basic merits of the secular monastery project is somewhat discouraged: The opposition already amply pervades ordinary life, while general support of the concept is assumed and therefore not considered a valuable contribution.

Debate on the merits of specific proposals is strongly encouraged.
