This web log is intended to be a serious record of economic and technical practices that individuals can use to promote free scholarship and critical inquiry in their present
 or future communities.

Contributions should generally describe specific techniques. On the other hand, the establishment of physical and psychological environments conducive to the practice of one'
s ethical principles is at least as important as the formation of the principles themselves (as pointed out by thinkers like [Jane Bennett](http://press.princeton.edu/titles/
7208.html)). For this reason, non-technical explanatory, didactic, or literary contributions themselves promoting free scholarship and critical inquiry are also welcome.

Any contributor may ask another to move or remove portions of their articles on the grounds that they lie outside the focus of this log or detract from its purpose, but they 
should not do so for reasons of merely personal irritation. Any author so asked should probably comply.
