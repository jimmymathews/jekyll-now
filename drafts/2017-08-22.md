On Sunday August 20th 2017, a group of us met on Roosevelt Island over Chinese food to discuss the future of this project. Those present were Jordan Mathews, Justin Mathews, Matt Trager, Josh Meyers, Matt Genkin, Deval Shah, and myself.

As a result of that meeting, and a later informal meeting that Josh arranged with Russell Dale and Sheila Hamanaka, I have a relatively fully-formed plan of action that I think will provide both sufficient structure for immediate progress in the short-term and sufficient flexibility for future goal-setting, while soliciting minimal commitment from most participants.

1. **Non-profit incorporation**
-------------------------------

An investigation of section [501(c)(3)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p557/ch03.html) and the other sections [501(c)(*)](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p557/ch04.html) of the IRS tax code show that there are certain regularities to which the federal government expects all not-for-profit organizations to adhere. Incorporation under 501(c)(3) requires that the principal activities benefit a public and not the members of the organization. We do expect our organization to do public good, but this must generally be evinced on the balance sheet and I don't expect our organization would qualify.

Incorporation under [501(d)](https://www.irs.gov/irm/part4/irm_04-076-029.html) as a communal/religious community engaged in small industry would seem to be a very promising alternative, except for the [ruling](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-tege/rr78-100.pdf) that expressly forbids such organizations from deriving substantial income from members' outside income (which is what I will propose below).

Incorporation under 501(c)(7) as a non-profit social club would seem to address these two issues. However, two new issues arise: The club cannot derive substantial income from a business activity, and also cannot open its facilities to the public.

So why incorporate at all? Remember that the point is to form a legally-recognized entity capable of assuming liability from the individuals comprising the group and engaging in contracts with other entities in such a way that the documentary foundation we lay for the organization is largely legally enforceable. For example, so that the group can delegate the power of opening and maintaining a bank account to a member in their capacity as "treasurer" or something similar, in such a way that the delegation and all other group actions would be supported by, say, civil courts were the legitimacy of these actions to be disputed by a third party.

The only alternative entity structure that I can see is an ordinary Limited Liability Corporation. The organization would be subject to ordinary business taxation. Actually, in exchange for taxation, private companies are given a frighteningly high degree of structural freedom in comparison to their non-profit counterparts. An LLC may choose taxation on the individual pass-through basis (as an S corporation) or as a standard C corporation. The basis for distributing taxable gains and losses to the members is permitted to be separate from the degree of ownership, which I think is a desirable flexibility.

*I'm not sure if this flexibility extends to the following situation: I wish for the ownership structure to be based on 

If we manage to incorporate in one of certain states, including e.g. Vermont (but not, unfortunately, New York), I would advocate the "L3C" corporate category, or "low-profit limited liability corporation", designed for private companies whose principal purpose is social in nature and not profit-maximization. It is easier for L3C entities to obtain funding from non-profit foundations, because grants to L3C organizations can qualify as a "Program-Related Investment", a form of expenditure sometimes required by the IRS.
