## Jimmy Mathews

I searched:
- Google Scholar
- NYPL catalog
- Anarchist Library
- Workplace: Journal of Academic Labor

Types of things I selected:
- Narrow, personal/individual-level critiques or suggestions for conduct that incorporates both rigorous study (including theory) and action. Intellectual.
- "Experiment-results"-type historical material. This is the Dewey stuff and Chautauqua stuff.
- Old, old texts. To gain perspective
- Work about old, old institutions.

Have not done a proper search for university-management texts aimed at practical advice for administrators. But this is something we should do.

## Josh again, summarizing

Many reasons for recommending books:

- historical interest
- classics in field of alternative education (Goldman, ..., John Taylor Gatto)
- history of schools/scholarly institutions
- funding side
- pedagogy side

## Andrius

1. A subcategory where we don't need to know the contents in detail.
2. A subcategory where at least 1 person needs to read in detail.
3. Some where everyone reads!

Limit the "required reading". Do "divide and conquer".

## Josh

- Need better organization in Zotero
- Identify research questions
